# Summary-GitHub-Sergej-van-Essen
Readme file with descriptions of my repositories to help people interested find their way around my GitHub repositories. Goal is to give an insight into my development as a developer, see my progress and my struggles along the way. At the moment I am using my GitHub to show my portfolio, but at a certain point I will be setting op my own webpage at my own domain to showcase my work (and of course still refer to my GitHub for code). My first few projects were mostly code alongs, but I intend to start adding some refactored and some new projects in the future, to show I can do more than just code along and copy. 

https://github.com/SAvanEssen/Todo-List-Project :

First attempt at using GitHub, just to check if I could make a repository and use the basic commands needed to put my code in the repository.

https://github.com/SAvanEssen/todolistsergej :

First real project committed to GitHub. Built a relatively simple to-do-list, this was quite early in the bootcamp.

Used HTML, CSS, Font-Awesome, Googleapis and JQuery.

https://github.com/SAvanEssen/viperblog :

First CRUD and RESTfull-routed App I built, first attempt at working with Semantic UI instead of just CSS or Bootstrap.

Used HTML, CSS, Javascript, Semantic UI, NodeJS, MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, Express-Sanitizer, Body-Parser, Method-Override. 

https://github.com/RGHommes/CGB_VO10 :

Project I worked on with Remmelt Hommes and Filip de Mesmaeker, building a desktopconfigurator. Our idea was to make it in such a way products could never be mismatched (ie no Intel processor on an AMD motherboard for instance, but also only good matches between processor, motherboard and memory (both motherboard and CPU should be a perfect fit and both would have to support the full performance possibilities of the memory and number of memory sticks and capacity should never be greater than the motherboard supports)). For this project we used the scrum method and kept track of the project and it's stages through Trello. Two weeks into the project we decided to put the project on hold due to our ambitions being too great for the time that was left in the CodeGorilla bootcamp, we would not be able to finish it and given the fact that both Remmelt and Filip were within 2 weeks of the end of the bootcamp for them. We did agree on continuing with the project some time after the bootcamp and turning it into a possibly commercialy viable product. For the first part of the project I focussed on the seedfile and the app itself, since we planned on first getting it to work localy before we would configure a database. Next step for me would have been to look for an API that could provide us with all (recent) data that could be used to fill a database with relevant productdata.

Used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, NodeJS, MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, Passport, Body-Parser sofar.

https://github.com/SAvanEssen/YelpCamp-Heroku :

There must be a million versions of YelpCamp out there, given the fact that I am not the only one to use Colt Steele's "The Webdeveloper Bootcamp" on Udemy as an introduction to webdevelopment to get the basics down, but here is mine. 

Colt Steele takes you by the hand and most of the project is a code along, but certainly not all, since the videocourse is a bit dated and not everything works in the same way as explained in the course. He uses cloud9 for instance and I chose to work localy at first. He uses MongoDBLab at some point, I used MongoDBAtlas. I did go along with some choices, like still working with an older Boostrap than currently available. Colt uses Sublime Text, I opted to use Microsoft Visual Studio Code with a BASH-terminal. Given the fact not everything worked as taught in the course, it was a good exercise to find good sources on Google. MDN, W3Schools and StackOverflow I frequently visited to find solutions to the challenges I ran into. My fellow CodeGorilla students and coaches were a big help as well, but in each case I did try and find a solution myself, so I had a good understanding of what I was doing. The course tought me to make a CRUD and RESTful-routed website
